# LightGBM Builder
A python package for building & reviewing performance of LightGBM models along with hyperparameter tuning.

## Installation
From command terminal,  run:

`pip install git+https://github.com/djdeepak72/LGBMbuilder.git`

OR `cd` into the repo directory & run:

`pip install .`


NOTE: The package was built a while back for training some colleagues(non-data scientists). Adding this in my github just to avoid storing it locally, & maybe i'll add in features as I have more time. 
The package itself works fine, but lacks a lot of advanced features & is intended for new starters or for those who want to build & evaluate a model quickly.

To know how to use the package, see the [Example notebook](tutorial/Example.ipynb).
